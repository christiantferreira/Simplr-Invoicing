## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Backend Architecture (Supabase-First)

- **API Layer:** Supabase auto-generated REST API + GraphQL
- **Real-time:** Supabase Realtime for live updates
- **Edge Functions:** Supabase Edge Functions for server-side logic
- **Row Level Security:** Built-in security and multi-tenancy

### 5.4 Supabase Security Best Practices

**Onboarding Flow RLS Issue:**
- **Problem:** New users were unable to complete the onboarding process due to a "permission denied for table settings" error. This occurred because the Row Level Security (RLS) policies were too restrictive, and the underlying table-level `GRANT` privileges for the `authenticated` role were missing.
- **Solution:** The fix involves two parts:
    1.  **Granting Table Permissions:** The `authenticated` role must be explicitly granted `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` permissions on the `public.settings` table.
    2.  **Implementing a Robust RLS Policy:** A single, comprehensive `FOR ALL` policy should be used on the `settings` table. This policy uses both `USING` (for read/update/delete operations) and `WITH CHECK` (for write operations) clauses to ensure users can only manage their own records.

- **Implementation Code:**
  ```sql
  -- 1. Grant base permissions to the authenticated role
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLE public.settings TO authenticated;

  -- 2. Drop any conflicting policies
  DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage their own settings" ON public.settings;
  -- (Include any other policy names that might exist)

  -- 3. Create the single, correct RLS policy
  CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own settings"
  ON public.settings
  FOR ALL
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
  ```
- **Note:** This pattern should be reviewed for all tables that new users need to interact with immediately upon signing up.
