# QA Fixes and Improvements

This document outlines the fixes and improvements identified during the QA session with Andr√© Adura on July 14, 2025.

## High Priority

### 1. Data Persistence in Onboarding Flow
- **Problem**: The onboarding form state is lost when the user switches browser tabs or refreshes the page.
- **Solution**: Implement `sessionStorage` to persist the form data and the current step.
  - Create a `useSessionStorage` custom hook.
  - Apply the hook to `OnboardingWizard.tsx`.
- **Additional Task**: Update the "Thank You" message text after onboarding is complete to instruct the user to check their email for verification.

### 2. Data Persistence in Client Creation Form
- **Problem**: Similar to the onboarding flow, data entered in the client creation form is lost when changing tabs.
- **Solution**: Apply the same `sessionStorage` persistence logic to the client creation form.
  - Identify the relevant component (`ClientForm.tsx` or `AddClientModal.tsx`).
  - Use the `useSessionStorage` hook to save form state.

## Medium Priority

### 3. Mobile Menu Navigation Bug
- **Problem**: The mobile navigation menu doesn't consistently close after clicking on the "Clients" link.
- **Solution**: Investigate the state management of the mobile menu in `Sidebar.tsx` and `Header.tsx` to ensure it closes reliably after a navigation event.

## Low Priority / Resolved

### 4. Supabase Redirect URL
- **Problem**: The email confirmation link was redirecting to `localhost`.
- **Status**: **Resolved**. The user has manually updated the URL in the Supabase settings.

### 5. Service Provider Restriction
- **Problem**: Ensure only service-based businesses can complete the onboarding.
- **Status**: The logic seems to be in place in `OnboardingWizard.tsx`. Will be verified during the implementation of the data persistence fix.
