### Phase 1: System Access & Core Logic Restoration (Current Priority)

**Objective:** Fix the critical bugs preventing the application from loading data and functioning correctly.

*Note: These are immediate blockers that must be resolved before pursuing PRD strategic initiatives. Aligns with Priority 1 items in PRD Gap Analysis.*

- [ ] **1.1 - Fix Data Access due to Missing RLS Policies**
  - **Priority:** BLOCKER.
  - **Analysis:** The application is receiving `403 Forbidden` errors because the new database `views` (`invoices_with_dynamic_status`, `clients_with_metrics`) were created without Row Level Security policies.
  - **Reference:** `docs/database_schema_and_rules.md`
  - **Action Plan:**
    - [ ] 1.1.1 **[Difficulty: 1]** **[MANUAL ACTION]** Apply the RLS policy for `invoices_with_dynamic_status`. I will provide the SQL script.
    - [ ] 1.1.2 **[Difficulty: 1]** **[MANUAL ACTION]** Apply the RLS policy for `clients_with_metrics`. I will provide the SQL script.

- [ ] **1.2 - Fix Client Creation Logic**
  - **Priority:** BLOCKER.
  - **Analysis:** Based on the official schema, the `addClient` function is failing because it attempts to insert a `gst_number` into the `clients` table, but that column does not exist.
  - **Action Plan:**
    - [ ] 1.2.1 **[Difficulty: 2]** **Modify `AddClientModal.tsx`**: Remove the "do they have a gst number?" checkbox, the `gstNumber` input field, and all related state and logic from the component.
    - [ ] 1.2.2 **[Difficulty: 1]** **Modify `useSupabaseInvoices.tsx`**: Remove the `gst_number` property from the `insert` statement inside the `addClient` function.
    - [ ] 1.2.3 **[Difficulty: 1]** **Update `types/index.ts`**: Remove the optional `gst_number` property from the `Client` interface to align with the database schema.

- [ ] **1.3 - Fix UI Flickering**
  - **Priority:** HIGH.
  - **Analysis:** The `InvoiceEditor.tsx` component has a `useEffect` hook that calls `setActiveInvoice`, which in turn re-triggers the same `useEffect`, creating an infinite render loop.
  - **Action Plan:**
    - [ ] 1.3.1 **[Difficulty: 2]** **Refactor `InvoiceEditor.tsx`**: Modify the `calculateTotals` `useEffect` to add a condition that prevents `setActiveInvoice` from being called if the calculated totals are the same as the ones already in the state.

---
*The following phases will be executed after the critical blockers in Phase 1 are resolved.*

- [ ] **2.2 - Fix Dark Theme**
  - *PRD Alignment: Supports professional UI requirements and user experience goals*
- [ ] **2.3 - Make Recent Invoices Clickable**
  - *PRD Alignment: Improves dashboard analytics and user workflow efficiency*

  - *PRD Alignment: Improves CRA compliance and professional invoice formatting*
- [ ] **4.3 - Simplify Invoice Template**
  - *PRD Alignment: Maintains template variety while ensuring usability (‚úÖ templates implemented)*

### Phase 5: Documentation and Support

*Note: Supports PRD quality and user adoption objectives, aligns with P4.2 developer experience.*

- [ ] **5.1 - Create Help & Support System**
  - *PRD Alignment: Critical for user adoption metrics and satisfaction goals*

## PRD Strategic Integration Notes

**Immediate Priorities:** Current Phase 1 blockers must be resolved before pursuing PRD strategic initiatives. Once stable, focus should shift to:

1. **PRD Priority 1 Critical Issues** (P1.1-P1.4) - Technical foundation
2. **Selected Phase 2-5 Tasks** - Tactical improvements  
3. **PRD Priority 2 Mobile Development** (P2.1-P2.5) - Strategic platform expansion
4. **PRD Priority 3 Advanced Features** (P3.1-P3.4) - Business completion

**Key Decision Points:**
- **Mobile Development Timing:** Consider initiating P2.1 (React Native setup) in parallel with Phase 2-3 tasks
- **Payment System Priority:** P1.3 (Complete Payment System) should integrate with Phase 3.2-3.3 tasks
- **Testing Infrastructure:** P1.2 (Testing Coverage) should be implemented alongside all development phases

**Resource Allocation Recommendation:**
- **60%** - Current Phase 1 blockers and PRD Priority 1 critical issues
- **25%** - Tactical Phase 2-5 improvements  
- **15%** - Strategic PRD mobile and advanced feature planning
