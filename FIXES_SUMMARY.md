# Simplr Invoicing - Issues Fixed Summary

## üéØ All 7 Issues Successfully Resolved

### ‚úÖ Issue #1: Backend Save Error ‚Äì ON CONFLICT Constraint
**Problem**: Settings save failed with "no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification"
**Solution**: 
- Replaced `upsert` with proper insert/update logic based on existing record ID
- Fixed in `src/pages/Settings.tsx`
- Now properly handles both new and existing company settings

### ‚úÖ Issue #2: Sidebar UI Bug ‚Äì "Settings" Text Cut Off
**Problem**: "Settings" text was partially cut off in the sidebar
**Solution**: 
- Increased sidebar width from `w-64` (256px) to `w-72` (288px)
- Fixed in `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- Provides adequate space for all navigation items

### ‚úÖ Issue #3: Invoice Preview Not Loading
**Problem**: Live preview showed "Loading preview..." indefinitely
**Solution**: 
- Added company settings loading to InvoiceContext
- Fixed type mapping between database schema and CompanySettings interface
- Updated `src/contexts/InvoiceContext.tsx`
- Preview now loads properly with company information

### ‚úÖ Issue #4: Invoice Totals ‚Äì Missing Subtotal Line
**Problem**: Subtotal line was not prominent enough in the invoice editor
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced subtotal display with border and bold text
- Updated `src/pages/InvoiceEditor.tsx`
- Subtotal now clearly visible above discount and tax fields

### ‚úÖ Issue #5: Invoice Cannot Be Opened After Save
**Problem**: Saved invoices couldn't be opened due to ID mismatch
**Solution**: 
- Fixed `addInvoice` function to properly save to Supabase database
- Returns actual database-generated ID instead of timestamp
- Updated `src/contexts/InvoiceContext.tsx`
- Invoices now save correctly and can be reopened

### ‚úÖ Issue #6: External Services Check ‚Äì Supabase, GitHub
**Problem**: Security vulnerabilities and configuration issues
**Solution**: 
- **CRITICAL**: Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent key exposure
- Created `.env.example` for documentation
- Comprehensive security review in `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`
- Identified and documented security recommendations
- Fixed potential data breach vulnerability

### ‚úÖ Issue #7: Print View ‚Äì Includes Full Layout
**Problem**: Print function included sidebar and UI elements
**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive print CSS styles to `src/index.css`
- Hides all UI elements except invoice content during print
- Added `id="invoice-content"` to InvoicePreviewPanel
- Print now shows only the clean invoice document
